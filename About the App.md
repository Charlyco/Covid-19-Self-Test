# Covid-19-Self-Test
An app that analyzes a user's symptoms and the determine the possibility of having Covid 19

I fee that there is undertesting within the African continent in general and Nigeria in particular. This can be attributed to the fact that we are not used to dialing 
emergency numbers such as that provided by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) for reportage of suspected cases. This prevents a lot of people from reaching 
out to the NCDC for testing when they experience symptoms similar to that of Covid-19. As a result, most people especially within the rural communities do not even know when,
where or how to present themselves for medical examination.

This app provides a very easy way for people to takes a self assessment test simply by selecting the symptoms they are experiencing from the list of Covid-19 related symptoms 
outlined by the app. Upon clicking submit, the app generates a recommendation based on the symptoms indicated by the user. This recommendation includes the degree of probability 
of having the virus and suggests the best actions to take.

The user as well can submit the test result which includes their name and contact details to the official email of the NCDC simply by clicking a button.

This will help increase the reportage of suspected cases since anyone with an Android phone can test and send the rest of as many persons as possible. This means that community 
heads can even employ the app as a local assessment tool for their communities and help forward the details of patients for quick response by the NCDC.  

Finally, the app uses a third party API to provide up-to-date statistics of the testing,  cases and deaths recorded so far in the 36 states of Nigeria and the FCT
