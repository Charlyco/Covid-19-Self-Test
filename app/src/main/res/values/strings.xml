    <string name="privacy_policy">COVID-19 SELF-ASSESSMENT APP PRIVACY POLICY \n \n
       Effective Date: January 30, 2021 \n \n
        This policy explains what information we collect when you use the Covid-19 Self-assessment mobile app.
        It also has information about how we store, use, transfer, and delete that information. \n \n

        Information We Collect &amp; How We Use It \n
        Due to the nature of the Covid-19 Self-assessment mobile app,
        you are required to input your name, state of resident and date of birth. These information
        are not used by our algorithm in anyway, however, we collect that since they are required for
        contact and evaluation by Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) in a case you decide to forward
        the assessment result generated by our app to NCDC. \n \n

        Information Disclosure \n
        Charlyco Technologies will not transfer information about you to third parties for the purpose of providing or facilitating
        third-party advertising to you. We won’t sell information about you to a third-party.
        The information we gather through the app is only transferred through your email account linked
        to your device to the official contact email address of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control. \n \n

        Data Storage \n
        Every data gathered through the taking a self-assessment test or any other user interaction with
        this mobile application is stored entirely locally on the user’s device. \n \n

        Modifying or Deleting \n
        Your Personal Information   If you decide to delete a test result on your device, the entire
        information related to that particular test, including the indicated symptoms and personal data
        are deleted.\n \n

        Data Security \n
        Since we do not transfer you data directly to the NCDC, the
        security of your data is determined by the security architecture of the email client you used. \n \n

        Charlyco Technologies may periodically update this Policy is the architecture or algorithms
        of this app changes in a way that warrants an update to this policy. We’ll notify you about
        significant changes to it. The most current version of the policy will always be bundled with the
        latest version of the app. Hence the privacy policy bundled with any version of this app is specific

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supersede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efficient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

        <b>WEAR A MASK PROPERLY AND WHENEVER NECESSARY</b> \n \n
        &#8226; Everyone 2 and older should wear masks in public. \n\n
        &#8226; Masks should be worn in addition to staying at least 6 feet apart, especially
        around people who don’t live with you. \n \n
        &#8226; If someone in your household is infected, people in the household should

        &#8226; Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before putting on your mask. \n \n
        &#8226; Wear your mask over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin. \n \n
        &#8226; Fit the mask snugly against the sides of your face, slipping the loops over
